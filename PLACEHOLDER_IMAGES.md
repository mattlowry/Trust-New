# Placeholder Images Inventory

This file tracks all placeholder images used throughout the Trust SoCal website. Each entry documents the image location, current placeholder source, required dimensions, and a description of what the final production image should depict.

**Important:** All placeholder images must be replaced with licensed, professional photography before production deployment.

## Image Guidelines
- Use hopeful, recovery-focused imagery (sunlight, nature, community)
- Ensure diverse representation in all people-focused images
- Avoid imagery that could be stigmatizing or triggering
- All images must be properly licensed (stock photo or custom photography)
- Optimize all images for web (WebP format preferred, appropriate compression)
